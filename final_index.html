  Figure Skating is a very popular winter olympic sport. Countries around the world are aiming to guarantee that the best athletes arrive on the world stage in February. The rankings are decided by The International Skating Union (ISU), using the total points of skaters from their past three seasons. This scoring system is difficult to understand at a first glance, but a more in depth overview can be found <a href=http://www.isu.org/communications/1625-1629-world-standing-sandp-id/file>here.</a> If you are interested in meeting the top skaters attempting to mae Team USA in 2018 click Next.

  Pairs skating is as popular around the world as the single's competitions. The US is not as competitive in this category as years past and the names you see in this chart will most likely not be too internationally competitive this Olympics.

Ice Dancing is the least popular event among Olympic viewers. The slower and more meticulous nature of the sport loses a lot of the adrenaline craving viewers that get a high from the jumps in the other three events. However, the US is extremely competitive in this event going into the 2018 Olympics. Source: <a href="http://www.isuresults.com/ws/ws/wsmen.htm">World Standings</a>
