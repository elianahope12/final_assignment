# final_assignment
Week 2

final_index.html is my project page

charts.css is my only css document 

script.js is where my highcharts are living and also where my javascript click and switch functions are living as well.

This week, I followed Ryan's comment from last week and added a "Back" button in Javascript. This was exceptionally challenging. I also organized the audio player and made it a functional part of the page. I have been working on the responsiveness for mobile for a very long time. You can see some of it in my html but it is not working the way I would like. I am confused and do not understand why not. 

https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/ I am working with this instruction, specifcally under the "stacked to horizontal" section. Any comments or help would be greatly appreciated. 

I know if I can get it to work for one grouping of text and visuals, I will be able to get it to work for the rest pretty easily. This first step is just really throwing a wrench in my plans to work through this approved for mobile idea. 

Additionally, I think I may have to leave the video background behind on mobile which I have been thinking about for weeks but was hoping I would crack the code on before I had to. 

(IF I sound bummed out it is because I am. This bootstrap has taken a year or two off of my life but I am very hopeful it will come to a happy end soon.)
