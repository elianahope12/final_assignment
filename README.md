# final_assignment
Week 3

final_index.html is my project page

charts.css is my only css document 

script.js is where my highcharts are living and also where my javascript click and switch functions are living as well.

This week, I added another button because of Ryan's comment from last week. This was exceptionally challenging and took time away from preparing the page for mobile which was my original goal for this week. 

I also organized the audio player and made it a functional part of the page. I have been working on the responsiveness for mobile for a very long time. You can see some of it in my html but it is not working the way I would like. I am confused and do not understand why not. The buttons look weird but are responsive so I left them this way so that I can see how to help the other parts become responsive. 

https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/ I am working with this instruction, specifically under the "stacked to horizontal" section. Any comments or help would be greatly appreciated. 

I know if I can get it to work for one grouping of text and visuals, I will be able to get it to work for the rest pretty easily. This first step is just really throwing a wrench in my plans to work through this approved for mobile idea. 

Additionally, I think I may have to leave the video background behind on mobile which I have been thinking about for weeks but was hoping I would crack the code on before I had to. 

(IF I sound bummed out its because I am. This bootstrap has taken a year or two off of my life but I am very hopeful it will come to a happy end soon.)
