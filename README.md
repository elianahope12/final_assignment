Week 1
This week, I was aiming to build my HighChart charts and to set up the basic HTML of the page. I was able to manipulate the css
I worked in a bootstrap theme and I was able to make all of the charts custom and responsive. I realized that I may struggle
with manipulating individual elements of my charts (like the colors of the bars) but I think there may be a way to dig deeper
and find the solution.

I am feeling confident in the work and in my understanding of where to go from here.
